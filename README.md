# Does-a-Basketball-Player-in-his-prime-Play-More-Than-Others-
In this project, we set out to make two accomplishments. First, we looked to determine if an NBA player in or near his prime plays more minutes than those not in their prime. Second, we aimed to develop a model to predict a player's minutes per game based on their points per game, field goals made per game, assists per game, and steals per game. The R code was written by me. The LaTeX file was written by Shakila Cham. And the report/study was a collaborative effort between myself, Thomas Connolly, and Shakila Cham. This project was a requirement of the course AMS 572: Data Analysis I at Stony Brook University.
